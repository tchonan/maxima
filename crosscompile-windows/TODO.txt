Improvements / TODOs for the crosscompiling script
==================================================

And some reasons why I did make some decisions...

1. The fixed installation directory (C:\Maxima-VERSION)
-------------------------------------------------------

That was chosen, because of four reasons:

- The default installation root ("C:\Program files") contains a space, which
  might cause issues, because one needs to escape it.

- The default installation path for a 32 Bit program is different on 32 and 
  64 Bit Windows Systems.

- When one builds Maxima using Autoconf, in './configure', the installation 
  prefix (--prefix=...) is set to a fixed value - and that value is used when 
  compiling maxima (at least in the manpage (not really relevant on Windows) 
  but also for some Lisp-variables (e.g. *autoconf-prefix*, ...).

- A user might choose a installation directory with problematic characters
  (e.g. UTF8 chars in another language, special characters), which might
  cause problems.

So making the installation directory fixed, solves these potential issues.


Letting the user select his installation directory might be nice, but might
lead to trouble.


2. Using other LISPs
--------------------

At first the crosscompiling procedure worked only with CLISP.
CLISP was selected, because it worked nice with "Wine" (which is needed for
crosscompiling) and they just released a ZIP file, which one can easy extract.

Now SBCL is also included (the MSI-Installer can be extracted using 7z and
a small shell script).

Using other LISPs might be a good idea (I tried it), but there are some issues:

GCL released exe installers (currently only for older versions)

ECL released an exe installer. 

Trying to crosscompile GCL or ECL did not work for me.

CCL released a ZIP File for windows (which is promising), but sadly it does
not work with wine.
